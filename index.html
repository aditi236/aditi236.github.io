                    <h2>History of Computer Science</h2>
                    <p>People have been using mechanical devices to aid calculation for thousands of years. For example, the abacus probably existed in Babylonia (present-day Iraq) about 3000 B.C.E. 
                        The ancient Greeks developed some very sophisticated analog computers. In 1901, an ancient Greek shipwreck was discovered off the island of Antikythera. 
                        Inside was a salt-encrusted device (now called the <span class="bold"> Antikythera mechanism</span>) that consisted of rusted metal gears and pointers.
                         When this c. 80 B.C.E. device was reconstructed, it produced a mechanism for predicting the motions of the stars and planets.</p>
                  <br> 
                  <p>In 1837 Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine which is accepted as the first design for a modern computer. 
                    The analytical engine had expandable memory, an arithmetic unit, and logic processing capabilities able to interpret a programming language with loops and conditional branching.</p>
